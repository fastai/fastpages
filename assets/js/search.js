    "title": "Introducing fastpages",
    "body": "2020/02/21 -            We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley.  Notebook posts support features such as:Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. Hide or show cell input and output. Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cellsAbility to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub's built-in markdown editor. Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. . . . and much morefastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the  View on GitHub  link above. fast. ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github's integrated online editor. Setting Up Fastpages&#182;The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working.  The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages&#182;In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides has for Jupyter notebooks.  You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. Options via FrontMatter&#182;: The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter.  Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook.  It is formatted like this: # Title&gt; Awesome summary- toc: true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true- author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard- categories: [fastpages, jupyter]All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contentsbadges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. comments: setting this to true will enable comments.  See these instructions for more details. author this will display the authors names. categories will allow your post to be categorized on a  Tags  page, where readers can browse your post by categories. Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks.  The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. Code Folding&#182;: put a #collapse_show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it:              #collapseimport pandas as pdimport altair as alt       put a #collapse_show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it:              #collapse_showcars = &#39;https://vega. github. io/vega-datasets/data/cars. json&#39;movies = &#39;https://vega. github. io/vega-datasets/data/movies. json&#39;sp500 = &#39;https://vega. github. io/vega-datasets/data/sp500. csv&#39;stocks = &#39;https://vega. github. io/vega-datasets/data/stocks. csv&#39;flights = &#39;https://vega. github. io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k. json&#39;       If you want to completely hide cells (not just collapse them), read these instructions Interactive Charts With Altair&#182;: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive!

More Examples&#182;: This tutorial contains more examples of what you can do with notebooks. How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts&#182;fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts.  When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically.  The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. Resources &amp; Next Steps&#182;We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog!Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category.  You can ask questions about fastpages here, as well as suggest new features. nbdev: this project powers the conversion of Jupyter notebooks to blog posts. If you end up writing a blog post using fastpages, please let us know on Twitter: @jeremyphoward, @HamelHusain. "

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! Front Matter&#182;: Front Matter is a markdown cell at the beginning of your notebook that allows you to inject metadata into your notebook. For example: Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contentsSetting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README.
